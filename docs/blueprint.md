## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) translates to a calming, professional blue (#4D94FF).
- Background color: A light, desaturated shade of blue, around HSL(210, 20%, 95%), or #F0F5FF, for a clean, modern feel.
- Accent color: A contrasting yet harmonious yellow-orange, approximately HSL(180, 60%, 60%), converted to #50D87A, used sparingly for call-to-action buttons and key highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a modern-looking sans-serif suited for both.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use clean, minimalist icons relevant to each section/service (e.g., a stethoscope for 'Services', a book for 'Patient Education').
- Use a clear grid system to structure content, ensuring consistent spacing and alignment across all sections.
- Incorporate smooth scrolling and subtle transitions between sections to enhance the user experience. Add gentle fade-in effects for content loading.
